This Model looks at Covid-19 Recovery in the NHS starting from a very simple goal gap model followed by a more complex model which could not be compiled using PySD.

The model structure is as below:

To see the working model please go to: https://electiverecovery.streamlit.app/

ASDM has now been released as an official PyPi Framework: https://pypi.org/project/asdm/

It can be installed with 

```bat
pip install asdm
```

However, we recommed setting up this notebook and script using pipenv

```bat 
pip install pipenv
```

Followed by 

```bat
pipenv install
```

Then you should be good to run the notebook in either VS code, jupyterlab or even streamlit - whichever is preferred.

We have tried to design the app in such a way that it will work as a tutorial
