# Elective_Recovery_Model
This Model looks at Covid-19 Recovery in the NHS

This version was developed from a model originally developed in Stella using the BPTK-Py framework by Transentis: https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial 

It is still in development but is starting to get there. If anyone would like to submit an issue or pull request feel free to do so.
