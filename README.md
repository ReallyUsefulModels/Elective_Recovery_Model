To see the working model please go to: https://reallyusefulmodels-elective-recovery-model-erm-asdm-app-kqu8vf.streamlitapp.com/

ASDM has now been released as an official PyPi Framework: https://pypi.org/project/asdm/

It can be installed with 

```bat
pip install asdm
```

However, we recommed setting up this notebook and script using pipenv

```bat 
pip install pipenv
```

Followed by 

```bat
pipenv install
```

Then you should be good to run the notebook in either VS code, jupyterlab or even streamlit - whichever is preferred
