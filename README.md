# Elective_Recovery_Model
This Model looks at Covid-19 Recovery in the NHS

This version was developed from a model originally developed in Stella using the BPTK-Py framework by Transentis: https://github.com/transentis/bptk_py_tutorial 

It is still in development but is starting to get there. If anyone would like to submit an issue or pull request feel free to do so.

The model structure is as below:
