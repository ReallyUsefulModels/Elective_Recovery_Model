# Elective_Recovery_Model
This Model looks at Covid-19 Recovery in the NHS

All 3 major python frameworks have been used to make this model

It is still in development but is starting to get there. If anyone would like to submit an issue or pull request feel free to do so.

The model structure is as below. As you can see it is more complex than the smoking cessation model so if you are new to system dynamics I strongly recommend you start there.
